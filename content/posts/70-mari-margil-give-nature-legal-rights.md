**Mari Margil** is director of the International Center for the Rights of Nature, a project of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, which is a public interest law firm that has assisted dozens of U.S. municipalities, as well as non-governmental organizations in different countries, to develop laws that recognize rights of nature.

In this episode we talk about how you can give for example a river its own rights, why we are not achieving anything by working within the existing environmental legal framework, how natures rights have been implemented in some places, what the challenges are and how the authorities have reacted.\
We also discussed the role of civil disobedience within the Rights of Nature movement.
