Marcus Carson is a Senior Research Fellow at Stockholm Environment Institute. We met at his office in late November to talk about his research on social change processes, with an emphasis on the social and political drivers and obstacles involved in developing policy responses to climate change. His key message is to think globally, act locally and to keep a really close look at the Arctic.

Prior to coming to Sweden with his family, Marcus was involved for nearly two decades in social change and policy advocacy at the national, state and local level in the US.

He received his PhD in Sociology in 2004 from Stockholm University, where he also earned his Associate Professorship in 2009.
