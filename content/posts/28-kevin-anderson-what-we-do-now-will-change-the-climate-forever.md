The 7th of November I met climate scientist **[Kevin Anderson](http://kevinanderson.info/)** at Uppsala university, where he is the [Zennström Visiting Professor](http://www.csduppsala.se/ccleadership/) in Climate Change Leadership.

Kevin Anderson is a also professor of energy and climate change at the [University of Manchester](http://www.mace.manchester.ac.uk/people/staff-spotlights/kevin-anderson/) and the deputy director of the [Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Researc\*\*h](http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/). He is one of Britain's most recognized and acclaimed climate scientist and has extensive experience in communicating climate science to policy makers, industry, civil society and media.

In this episode Kevin talks about carbon budgets as a way of telling us what we need to do in order to reduce our emissions, flying at the expense of future generations, our immoral lifestyle at the expense of the poor suffering the consequences of climate change, the need for a regulatory framework to reduce our emissions and the catalysts of for change.

In Sweden, Kevin Anderson has made the headlines for taking the train between Uppsala and Manchester. He explains why he stopped flying 12 years ago and about the impact of setting an example.

Although he has been accused of being a pessimist, he believe that it is not his job to give us hope, but to communicate what he knows clearly and bluntly. The job of the scientists is being completed and what we really need now are the storytellers, the arts and the humanities who can translate the science into a language that we are all familiar with.
