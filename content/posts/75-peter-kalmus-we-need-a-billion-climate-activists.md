**Peter Kalmus** a climate scientist at NASAs Jet propulsion Lab where he uses satellite data and models to study the rapidly changing Earth, focusing on boundary layer clouds and ecological forecasting. \
His award-winning book, **Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution** gives real life solutions to move away from a consumerist lifestyle that isn’t even making us happy.\
I met Peter on Zoom just a few days before the US Election. \
We talked about why he quit his job as an astro physicist to become a climate scientist and activist, and completely changed his life style and why it is so important to live as you preach, to gain credibility and that we need to become a billion climate activists\
He explains why the soft deniers are just as dangerous as the hard deniers and why we need a super strong grass root climate movement and bring the soft deniers into it.\
