**Rob Hopkins** is an independent activist and writer on environmental issues, based in Totnes, England and the founder and figurehead of the **Transition movement**, which he initiated in 2005.

In this episode Rob talks about the powerful transition movement, permaculture, the importance of imagination to rebuild the world, why we need to talk a lot more about resilience rather than sustainability, the tyranny of volunteerism, and why the transition movements need entrepreneurs but also psychotherapists.
