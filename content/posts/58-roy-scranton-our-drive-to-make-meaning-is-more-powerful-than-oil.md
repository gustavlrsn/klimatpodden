We recorded this conversation in front of a very engaged audience at the public library in Gothenburg during [The Gothenburg Filmfestival](https://goteborgfilmfestival.se/) on the 26th of January. The theme for this years film festival was the Apolaypse, so many thanks to the festival who chose to expose the climate crises in many different ways and also thanks to Martin Holmqvist at the [Gothenburg Public Library](https://www.stadsbiblioteket.nu/), who hosted this conversation.
