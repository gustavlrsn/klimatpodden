Renee Lertzman is an environmental engagement, research and strategy advisor, living in Berkeley in California. I met Renee in October and had a very inspiring conversation about the psychology of climate change, how climate anxiety is affecting us , why it is crucial that we create space for conversations were we can express our feelings about climate change and why blaming and shaming people for their behavior is not a very effective way to create action and engagement. To be able to create a more sustainable world Renee says that we need people who understand psychology working in partnership with people who understand the global environmental situation and people who understand how organizations operate.
