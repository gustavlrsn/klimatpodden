Kimberly Nicholas is a sustainability scientist at Lund University. She is the author of UNDER THE SKY WE MAKE: How to be Human in a Warming World, and the monthly climate newsletter We Can Fix It. \
Born and raised on her family’s vineyard in Sonoma, California, she studied the effect of climate change on the California wine industry for her PhD in Environment and Resources at Stanford University.\
Her goal is to understand how to steward ecosystems to support a good life for everyone alive today, and leave a thriving planet for future generations.\
I met Kimberly in her yard in Lund in the middle of June to talk about her new book and what its like to be a climate scientist during this escalating climate crises, how to make people aware of the fact that we need to act now and that we need to change our exploitation mindset into a regeneration mindset and redefine what a good life is really about. We also talked about why feelings are so important and the need to make space for grief, but also for visions and how we as individuals have much more power to make meaningful change than most of us realise.
